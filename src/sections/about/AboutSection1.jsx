                                        The supply of native plant seed has been tightly limited in the decades since native plant rehabilitation began. This is for several reasons. Native plants rely on very particular weather sequences besides their own trait tendencies to set seed in a commercially viable way and it is common for viable crops of trees and shrubs to only appear every five to ten years. There are large knowledge barriers to entry. Thereâ€™s considerable risk in holding relatively high cost products reliant on a relatively small market.
